# 🧭 Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
It covers dataset overview, summary statistics, visualizations, survival analysis, and key insights.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the following Python packages before running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
---
## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python eda.py
```
### The script will:

1.  Load the Titanic dataset using sns.load_dataset('titanic')

2. Display dataset overview including shape, column info, and missing values

3. Show summary statistics for key numerical columns

4. Generate and save visualizations, including:

    * Age and Fare distributions

    * Survival counts and rates by gender, class, and age group

    * Correlation heatmap and pairplot

5. Print key insights at the end of the analysis

## 📊 Key Insights
-  Women and children had higher survival rates.
 -   First-class passengers survived more often than third-class.
  -  Higher fares were associated with better survival chances.
